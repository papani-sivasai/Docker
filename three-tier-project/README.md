# Containerising a Three-Tier MERN E-Commerce Application with Docker and Nginx

> Build and deploy a complete MERN stack e-commerce app using Docker, Nginx, and Docker Compose.

So far in this series, weâ€™ve learned how to build Docker images, run containers, manage networks, use volumes, and simplify setups with Docker Compose.

Now, letâ€™s put it all together into a **real-world, three-tier e-commerce MERN application** using **Docker + Nginx**.

---

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

* How to containerize a **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** app
* Writing separate **Dockerfiles** for frontend and backend
* How Docker Compose connects multi-container apps
* Why you canâ€™t directly access containerized apps via localhost
* How **Nginx** solves this using reverse proxy and static serving

---

## Application Overview

This e-commerce app consists of four layers:

| Layer        | Technology                    | Purpose                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Frontend** | React + Vite (`client/`)      | Customer UI                    |
| **Backend**  | Node.js + Express (`server/`) | Business logic and API         |
| **Database** | MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)         | Data storage                   |
| **Proxy**    | Nginx                         | Handles frontend + API routing |

## Why Do We Need Nginx?

When both frontend and backend run in Docker, they can talk to each other internally using Dockerâ€™s network DNS (e.g., `http://backend:5000`), **but your browser cannot resolve that hostname**.

So, fetching data from `http://backend:5000` in your React app results in:

```
net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```

Even with exposed ports, browsers only know **localhost**, not container names.

### Nginx Solves This By:

* Serving your React app directly to the browser
* Forwarding `/api` requests to the backend container
* Acting as the **single entry point** ([http://localhost](http://localhost))
* Eliminating **CORS** and DNS issues

Think of **Nginx as the front door** to your entire Dockerized application.

## Architecture Diagram

```
Browser
   â†“
Nginx Container  â†’  Serves React (Frontend)
   â†“
Backend (Express)  â†’  Connects to MongoDB Atlas
```

Browser only communicates with Nginx
Nginx handles both static assets and API routes
Backend connects securely to MongoDB Atlas

## Folder Structure

```bash
three-tier-ecommerce/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ client/          # React frontend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .dockerignore
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ server/          # Express backend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .dockerignore
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ nginx/           # Nginx configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nginx.conf
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
```

---

## Backend (Server) â€” Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight Node base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the source code
COPY . .

# Expose the server port
EXPOSE 5000

# Start the backend
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses small `node:18-alpine` image.
* Installs dependencies efficiently.
* App runs on port **5000** inside the container.

---

## Frontend (Client) â€” Multi-Stage Dockerfile

React apps need to be built and then served. Weâ€™ll use a **multi-stage build** for smaller, optimized images.

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the React app
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

**Explanation:**

* Stage 1 â†’ builds the React app.
* Stage 2 â†’ uses Nginx to serve static files.
* Keeps image light and no Node.js in production.

---

## Nginx Configuration

Create a config file at `nginx/nginx.conf`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost; # Change to your domain if deploying to production

    # Serve React frontend
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://frontend:80;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_intercept_errors on;
        error_page 404 = /index.html;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }

    # Proxy API requests to backend
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://backend:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Serves React files at `/`.
* Forwards `/api` calls to backend.
* Single entry point (`localhost`).

---

## Docker Compose File

Hereâ€™s how we connect everything.

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build: ./server
    container_name: ecommerce-backend
    image: backend
    ports:
      - "5500:5000"
    env_file:
      - ./server/.env
    networks:
      - ecommerce-network
    restart: always

  frontend:
    build: ./client
    container_name: ecommerce-frontend
    image: frontend
    expose:
      - "80"
    env_file:
      - ./client/.env
    depends_on:
      - backend
    networks:
      - ecommerce-network
    restart: always

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: ecommerce-nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
    depends_on:
      - frontend
      - backend
    networks:
      - ecommerce-network

networks:
  ecommerce-network:
    driver: bridge
```

**Explanation:**

* All containers share the same `ecommerce-network`.
* Only **Nginx** exposes port 80 to the host.
* Nginx depends on both frontend and backend.

## Run Everything

Build and start all containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Expected output:

```
âœ” Network ecommerce-network  Created
âœ” Container ecommerce-backend Started
âœ” Container ecommerce-frontend Started
âœ” Container ecommerce-nginx  Started
```

Now open [http://localhost](http://localhost)
 React app loads
API requests flow through Nginx
Backend connects to MongoDB Atlas
No CORS or DNS issues

---

## Summary

Youâ€™ve just containerized a **three-tier MERN app** using everything learned so far:

* Dockerfiles for frontend & backend
* Docker Compose for orchestration
* Shared network communication
* Nginx reverse proxy as single entry point

This setup mirrors production-grade architecture used by modern full-stack apps.
